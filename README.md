htpolynet is a Python utility for generating atomistic models of cross-linked polymer networks together with appropriate topology and parameter files required for molecular dynamics simulations using Gromacs.  It is intended as a fully automated system builder requiring as inputs only the molecular structures of any monomer species, a description of the polymerization chemistry, and a handful of options describing desired system size and composition.  htpolynet uses the Generalized Amber Force Field for atom-typing and parameter generation.

## Installation

From PyPI:
```bash
pip install htpolynet
```

From conda-forge:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge htpolynet
```

From source:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:cameronabrams/htpolynet.git
cd htpolynet
pip install -e .
```

Once installed, the user has access to the main ``htpolynet`` command.

IMPORTANT NOTES: The programs ``antechamber``, ``parmchk2`` and ``tleap`` from AmberTools must be in your path.  These can be installed using the ``ambertools`` package from ``conda-forge`` or compiled from source.  You also need Gromacs installed so ``gmx`` is in your path.  The examples show how to build input monomer structures using OpenBabel, so to use them you need ``obabel`` in your path as well.

## Docker

As an alternative to a local installation, a prebuilt container image is published at ``ghcr.io/cameronabrams/htpolynet``.  It bundles htpolynet together with Gromacs, AmberTools, and OpenBabel, so no additional dependencies are required on the host beyond Docker (and, optionally, the NVIDIA Container Toolkit for GPU runs).

Run htpolynet against a configuration file in the current directory:
```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/work ghcr.io/cameronabrams/htpolynet run config.yaml
```

With GPU support:
```bash
docker run --rm --gpus all -v $(pwd):/work ghcr.io/cameronabrams/htpolynet run config.yaml
```

A Docker Compose file is also provided in [docker/compose.yml](docker/compose.yml) for a shorter invocation (``docker compose run --rm htpolynet run config.yaml``).  See [docs/source/user-guide/container-usage.rst](docs/source/user-guide/container-usage.rst) for the full story, including Singularity/Apptainer use on HPC systems.

## Repository relocation

This repository formerly lived at `AbramsGroup/HTPolyNet` and now lives at
[cameronabrams/htpolynet](https://github.com/cameronabrams/htpolynet).  GitHub redirects
the old URLs, so existing clones and forks continue to work; if you prefer, you can
update your remote explicitly:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:cameronabrams/htpolynet.git
```

## Acknowledgments

htpolynet grew out of the original HTPolyNet prototype begun by Ming Huang in 2020.
Ketan S. Khare contributed early LAMMPS-related utilities, and S. Alexis Paz contributed
a bug fix.  The current package is a full rewrite, but the project owes its origins and
its published description to that earlier work.  When using htpolynet in published work,
please cite Huang and Abrams, *SoftwareX* **21**, 101303 (2023),
[doi:10.1016/j.softx.2022.101303](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2022.101303), along with
the GAFF and Gromacs papers listed in the [documentation](https://htpolynet.readthedocs.io/).
